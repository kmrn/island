# Island Defender
A simple artillery shooter game. This is my first Unity3D game ever! I made it over the course of a few days as my Introduction to Game Programming Final Project.

##Controls:
Use the Mouse to control the turret.
Left Click to shoot!
<hr />
Shoot the evil exploding boats before they have a chance to destroy Sombrero Island!
Press Escape to unlock your cursor.

##Known Bugs:
* you can still shoot the boats in the game over screen and they count towards the score counter
  * don't do that its cheating
* if you do the above the score counter starts counting up for no reason
