# Island Defender
A simple artillery shooter game. This was my first Unity3D game ever! I made it over the course of a few days as my Introduction to Game Programming Final Project in Fall 2014. Some people suggested I put online so here it is. I decided it would be a good idea to put ads up there to maybe get a little bit of funding to put towards my future projects. Sorry if you don't like them :(

##Controls:
* Use the Mouse to control the turret.
* Left Click to shoot!
* Shoot the evil exploding boats before they have a chance to destroy Sombrero Island!
* Press Escape to unlock your cursor.

##Known Bugs:
* you can still shoot the boats in the game over screen and they count towards the score counter
  * don't do that its cheating
* if you do the above the score counter starts counting up for no reason
